 <b>Project Bank Marketing</b>
 
 The core business of Financial Institute is lending and borrowing. Lending generates revenue in the form of interest from customer with some level of default risk involved. Low risk strategy to bank is to attract public savings into the bank. To achieve this, one of the popular strategy bank uses is telemarketing.
Telemarketing is an interactive technique of direct marketing via phone, which is used widely by banks to sell long term deposits.
In this project, the objective of the study is to predict whether customer subscribes for long term deposit through telemarketing or not, apart from that, I am trying to analyse the characteristics of clients who are predicted to invest in the long-term deposits. This will help the bank to plan and allocate resources to focus certain customer segments to increase the revenue. It helps them to have their marketing campaign more effective and finding new and innovative strategies to improve future marketing campaigns. In the first part to know better the data some descriptive analysis is performed. In the second part I described about classification Models that use different information for the prediction can contribute to better analyses and a better understanding of the factors that influences in the prediction.
